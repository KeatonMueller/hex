# hex

This is my Senior Project for my Computer Science degree at Yale University.

It involves creating an intelligent agent to play the game of Hex, a board game
where one's objective is to connect opposite sides of the board.

This project is coded in Java version 11.

## How to use it

This project requires you have the Java SDK installed. It was coded using Java 11,
but other versions may work as well.

To run the program, clone the repo and run:

`make run`
